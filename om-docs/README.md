# Edge communication using Predictive and Change Point models in Watson IoT and IBM DSX (IoT)  

Internet of Things (IoT) have evolved tremendously in all spheres of our lives like Industrial
applications, Social interactions, Remote management of facilities and equipment to name a few.
In general application areas, IoT data collected by Sensors can be used for monitoring as
well as predicting the outcomes. If any deviation from the norm is detected, corrective action can be prescribed either manually or by an automated process. Such actions may come out of Rule based anomaly detection or a Statistical Change point detection or a Predictive model that predicts a faulty condition ahead of time.
The Process steps for applying Analytics on IoT data can be broadly classified as below  
  
1.	Collect IoT data from sensor
2.	Change Point detection using IoT Sensor data
3.	Predicting Equipment failure using IoT Sensor data
4.	Sending Decisions based on Analytics insights to the edge for Automated Action  
  
This IBM Code Pattern is a composite pattern that brings together the end to end flow of IoT Analytics systems.
Specifically focussing on points 2,3,4 above.
